# Exercise #1
# -----------
#
# Load, resize and rotate an image. And display it to the screen.

# First step is to 'import' the opencv module which is called 'cv2'.
import cv2

# Check the opencv version and display it with 'print'.
print(cv2.__version__)

# Load an image with image reading modes using 'imread'.
# cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED  - If set, return the loaded image as is (with alpha
#                         channel, otherwise it gets cropped). Ignore EXIF
#                         orientation.
# cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE  - If set, always convert image to the single channel
#                         grayscale image (codec internal conversion).
# cv2.IMREAD_COLOR      - If set, always convert image to the 3 channel BGR
#                         color image.
img = cv2.imread("../data/images/logo.png")

# Check if image is loaded fine and raise a FileNotFoundError if not.
if img is None:
    raise FileNotFoundError("image file not found")

# Resize image with 'resize'.
img_larger = cv2.resize(img, (300,400))

# TODO Rotate image (but keep it rectangular) with 'rotate'.
img = cv2.rotate(img, cv2.ROTATE_90_CLOCKWISE)

# Save image with 'imwrite'.
cv2.imwrite("output.jpg", img)

# Show the image with 'imshow'.
cv2.imshow("my image", img)

# Avoid the immediate closing of the image window with 'waitKey'.
cv2.waitKey(0)
